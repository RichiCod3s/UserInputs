# UserInputs

 Assignment 1 - Unique Values
 The program is designed to take an input of values and display the vaule only if it is not a duplicate. Non duplicate values will be places in a 1-D array and all non duplicate value to be displayed at the end.

Assignment 2 - Unique Values (Sets)
The program is designed to take an input of values and display the value only if it is not a duplicate. Non duplicate values will be places in a set, in my case a TreeSet and all non-duplicate value to be displayed at the end.

In conclusion, it was great to learn about sets, I have never used them before, and I loved the fact that sets automatically do not accept any duplicates. This was great to learn and meant that the assignment took very little to develop. A great learning experience.

Assignment 3 â€“ File Reading
The program is designed to read a file with the file name input by the user and error handle in the event of an error such as the file not being found. The program reads each line in the file and displays the number of lines and characters in the file.
